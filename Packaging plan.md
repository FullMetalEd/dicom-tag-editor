Plan to Package and Distribute DICOM Tag Editor for Linux (Nix/NixOS) and Windows

1. Prepare the Python Project for Packaging
Ensure the project has a standard structure:
dicomtageditor/ (Python package)
main.py (entry point)
pyproject.toml and/or setup.py (for build/metadata)
requirements.txt (dependencies)
Add a CLI entry point: fm-dtedit that runs the app, optionally with a file path.
Add a desktop entry (.desktop file) for launching from the desktop environment.
2. Nix/NixOS Packaging (with Flake)
Create a Nix flake:
Write a flake.nix that builds a Python environment with all dependencies (PyQt6, pydicom, pynetdicom, etc).
Use python3.withPackages to include dependencies.
Install the CLI script as fm-dtedit.
Install the .desktop file and icon to appropriate locations.
Test:
Build and run the app via nix develop and fm-dtedit.
Test launching from the desktop environment.
3. Windows Packaging
Prepare for Windows:
Ensure all dependencies are available via PyPI or wheels.
Add a Windows icon.
Create an installer:
Use PyInstaller to create a standalone .exe.
Bundle the icon and .desktop-like shortcut (Windows Start Menu shortcut).
Optionally, use NSIS or Inno Setup for a proper installer.
Test:
Run the .exe on a clean Windows VM.
Test file association and launching.
4. Documentation
Write clear install instructions for both Linux (Nix/NixOS) and Windows.
Document the CLI usage (fm-dtedit [file]).
Document how to launch from the desktop.
5. (Optional) Distribution
Publish the flake to a public repo for easy Nix installation.
Publish Windows installer on GitHub Releases or similar.
Next Steps:

Refactor the Python project for packaging (add entry point, CLI, etc).
Write the flake.nix and supporting files for Nix/NixOS.
Add a .desktop file and icon.
Prepare for Windows packaging (PyInstaller spec, icon).
Test and iterate.
